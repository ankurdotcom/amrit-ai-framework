```

## üîê **ENCRYPTION AND STORAGE SYSTEM**

### **Local Vault Architecture**
```yaml
Vault Structure:
  ~/.amrit/org-vault/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault.encrypted              # Main encrypted knowledge store
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keys/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master.key               # Organization master key
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session.key              # Session encryption key
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backup.key               # Emergency recovery key
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ access.log               # Knowledge access audit trail
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning.log             # Pattern learning activity
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ export.log               # Any data export attempts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ privacy.yml              # Privacy preferences
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sharing.yml              # Knowledge sharing settings
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security.yml             # Security configuration

Encryption Specifications:
  Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
  Key Length: 256 bits
  Salt: Unique per organization
  IV: Random per encryption operation
  HMAC: SHA-256 for integrity verification
```

### **Key Management System**
```yaml
Master Key Generation:
  Source: PBKDF2 with organization identifier + user passphrase
  Iterations: 100,000 (NIST recommended minimum)
  Salt: Unique 256-bit random salt per organization
  Output: 256-bit master encryption key

Session Key Management:
  Generation: Derived from master key + timestamp
  Rotation: Every 24 hours or 1000 operations
  Scope: Limited to current development session
  Cleanup: Automatic secure deletion after session

Emergency Recovery:
  Backup Key: Encrypted with organization emergency passphrase
  Recovery Process: Multi-factor authentication required
  Audit Trail: Complete logging of recovery operations
  Validation: Integrity check before knowledge restoration
```

## üß† **ORGANIZATION KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION**

### **Pattern Learning Engine**
```yaml
Learning Sources:
  - Code repository analysis
  - Commit message patterns
  - Pull request review styles
  - Issue tracking preferences
  - Testing methodology patterns
  - Documentation standards
  - CI/CD pipeline configurations
  - Security compliance practices

Pattern Categories:
  Coding Standards:
    - Language-specific style preferences
    - Naming convention patterns
    - Code organization structures
    - Comment and documentation styles
    - Error handling approaches

  Technology Preferences:
    - Framework and library choices
    - Database technology patterns
    - Infrastructure preferences
    - Tool and service integrations
    - Performance optimization approaches

  Workflow Patterns:
    - Development process preferences
    - Testing and QA methodologies
    - Deployment and release patterns
    - Collaboration and communication styles
    - Project management approaches
```

### **Intelligent Adaptation System**
```yaml
Adaptation Process:
  1. Analyze current project requirements
  2. Extract relevant organization patterns
  3. Apply patterns to framework decisions
  4. Validate adaptations against requirements
  5. Generate customized project configuration

Pattern Application:
  Technology Stack Selection:
    - Weight organization preferences highly
    - Consider team expertise and experience
    - Balance innovation with reliability
    - Optimize for maintenance and support

  Architecture Decisions:
    - Apply proven organization patterns
    - Customize for specific requirements
    - Ensure consistency with existing systems
    - Plan for integration and scalability

  Process Integration:
    - Match existing workflow patterns
    - Integrate with current tools and systems
    - Respect team collaboration preferences
    - Maintain quality and security standards
```

## üîÑ **KNOWLEDGE ISOLATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Data Movement Controls**
```yaml
Local Processing Only:
  Rule: All organization pattern analysis occurs locally
  Enforcement: Air-gapped processing environment
  Validation: Network isolation during pattern extraction
  Monitoring: Real-time detection of unauthorized data access

Anonymization for Generic Learning:
  Process:
    1. Strip all organization-identifying information
    2. Aggregate patterns across multiple organizations
    3. Generalize specific patterns to universal principles
    4. Validate anonymization completeness
    5. Apply differential privacy techniques

  Examples:
    Organization Pattern: "Use React with company-specific UI library"
    Generic Learning: "React with custom UI libraries shows 15% productivity gain"
    
    Organization Pattern: "Deploy to AWS with company security policies"
    Generic Learning: "Cloud deployment with enhanced security increases reliability"
```

### **Audit and Compliance System**
```yaml
Access Monitoring:
  - Every knowledge vault access logged
  - User identification and authentication tracking
  - Purpose and scope of data access recorded
  - Success/failure status monitored
  - Unusual access patterns detected and alerted

Compliance Validation:
  - Regular privacy policy compliance checks
  - Encryption strength validation
  - Key rotation and management audits
  - Data isolation boundary verification
  - Security vulnerability assessments

Export Controls:
  - Explicit consent required for any data export
  - Purpose and destination must be specified
  - Automatic anonymization for external sharing
  - Complete audit trail of export operations
  - User notification of all export activities
```
