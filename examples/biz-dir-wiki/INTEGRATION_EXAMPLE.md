# 🔗 BIZ-DIR WIKI INTEGRATION EXAMPLE
*Real-World Framework Implementation Case Study*

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This is a real-world example of Amrit Framework applied to the biz-dir wiki separation project, demonstrating:

- **Requirement Analysis**: Plain-text business requirements processing
- **Architecture Design**: Optimal technology stack selection
- **Implementation**: Automated development with quality assurance
- **Deployment**: Production-ready system with monitoring

## 📋 **ORIGINAL BUSINESS REQUIREMENT**

```markdown
Business Requirement: Wiki System Separation

We need to separate the wiki system from the main business directory application 
to create an independent, maintainable wiki platform.

Requirements:
- Migrate 86 existing documents with 5-tier access control
- Maintain current Wiki.js functionality
- Ensure zero downtime during migration
- Create comprehensive documentation and automation
- Implement monitoring and backup systems
- Provide easy management tools for ongoing operations

Technical Preferences:
- Docker containerization for portability
- MySQL database for reliability
- Nginx for performance and security
- Comprehensive backup and recovery systems
```
