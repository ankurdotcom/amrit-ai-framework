```

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Extract explicit requirements from document
2. Infer implicit requirements based on domain
3. Identify potential risks and constraints
4. Suggest missing requirements that should be considered
5. Classify complexity based on feature interactions
6. Estimate effort based on similar projects

CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Business domain best practices
- Industry compliance requirements
- Scalability and performance standards
- Security and privacy regulations
- Technology ecosystem compatibility
```

## üéØ **DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION PROMPT**

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
1. Identify primary business domain
2. Analyze domain-specific requirements
3. Consider regulatory and compliance needs
4. Evaluate scalability requirements
5. Assess security and privacy needs

TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest optimal technology stack
2. Consider existing technology constraints
3. Evaluate long-term maintainability
4. Factor in team capabilities
5. Balance innovation with reliability

```

## üéØ **COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT PROMPT**

```
ROLE: Technical Architect & Project Manager

TASK: Assess project complexity and provide development estimates.

COMPLEXITY FACTORS:
1. Feature interdependencies
2. Technology integration challenges
3. Scalability requirements
4. Security complexity
