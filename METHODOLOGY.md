3. **Production Ready**: Every slice deployable to production
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build complexity incrementally

### **Release Cadence:**
- **Daily**: Internal builds and testing
- **Weekly**: Feature releases to staging
- **Bi-weekly**: Production deployments
- **Monthly**: Major feature milestones

### **Quality Gates Per Release:**
```mermaid
